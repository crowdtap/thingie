# Crowdtap Thingie

Every Crowdtapper has one of these on their desk so we can see, at a glance,
if they are in and willing to chat. This is based on the output of a single
RGB LED. See below for colors that represent states.

## Hardware

Based on an [Arduino Fio](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardFio),
a presence sensor, a few switches and an RGB LED. This will have three
states to show availability:

- Not present (RED)
- Present (GREEN)
- Quiet please (BLUE)
